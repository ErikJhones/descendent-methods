# Descent Methods

This repository contains the Python code for the implementations of the following minimization algorithms:  
**Descent gradient** (with backtranking, exact line search);  
**Steepest descent** (with squared norm);  
**Newton's Method** (with backtracking).  

**The function to be minimized is:**  
*f(x1, x2)* = exp(x1 + 3x2 - 0.1) + exp(x1 - 2x2 - 0.1) + exp(-x1 - 0.2)
