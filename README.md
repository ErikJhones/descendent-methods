# descendent-methods
This repository contains the Python code for the implementations of the following minimization algorithms:  
Descent gradient (with backtranking, exact line search);  
Steepest descent (with squared norm);  
Newton's Method (with backtracking).

h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x) = &theta;<sub>o</sub> x + &theta;<sub>1</sub>x
